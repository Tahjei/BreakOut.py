# Breakout

## Purpose
Labs 10-14 will constitute the remainder of the semester and will involve the development of the classic Atari game Breakout.
Lab 9 was an introduction to working in real-time environments.
Now that you have had time to play with and experiments with developed code, it is time to start writing it yourself.

That being said, these labs serve 3 main purposes:
* Giving you exposure to larger codebases (similar to the first incremental project).
* Working with and achieving __milestones__ (you may already be familiar with this if you've taken ENGR 121).
* Working as part of a team to achieve success in coding.
 
> __PAIRED PROGRAMMING:__ We will be implementing paired programming in a similar fashion as the previous half of the semester.
Working as part of a group always presents a new set of challenges due to the differences and opinions of others.
I encourage everyone to treat this project as an opportunity to improve collaborating with others (even if you are already an excellent programmer).
Always keep in mind that companies are looking for individuals who can work well with a team, this is true across every discipline.

>__TAKE AWAY:__ At the end of the semester, you should have something that you would be proud to show off to your friends and family.
You may also be able to add this project as part of your resume when you're looking for internships.

## Schedule
In order to better help you succeed at this project, we have divided it into 5 parts.
Each part will consist of a 1-Week lab, and will have milestones that you will be required to meet.
The last lab of the semester will not be a work lab, but instead a time to present what you've achieved.

> __NOTE:__ This schedule and milestones of _future labs_ are subject to changes depending on the status of most groups.

* __Lab 10 - Inheritance__
  * This lab will focus on implementing game objects as the children of PyGame Sprites.
  * This lab will have you create all objects and multiple, different bricks.
* __Lab 11 - Real-time programming II__
  * This lab will focus on working in the update loop.
  * Unlike lab 9, there will be a larger emphasis on debugging movement code and fixing issues related to real-time systems.
  * In this lab you should also begin to track items such as lives and levels.
* __Lab 12 - Binary File I/O__
  * This lab will focus on using File I/O to store gamedata and allow a game to be saved.
* __Lab 13 - Integration__
  * This lab is designed to give you a week to add your own touches to the game.
  * Ideas will be given, but feel free to add whatever you want to the game.
  * This lab will offer you an opportunity to catch up if you have fallen behind.
* __Lab 14 - Presentations__
  * This week will consist of the end-of-semester "Super" quiz.
  * You will present your projects in 5 minute time slots.

### Grading Overview
* 100 points | Week 10 Milestones (graded on Week 11)
* 100 points | Week 11 Milestones (graded on Week 12)
* 100 points | Week 12 Milestones (graded on Week 13)
* 100 points | Week 13 Milestones (graded on Week 14)
* 100 points | Week 14 Presentation
* 300 points | Final Project Submission (due during finals week [date TBD])

All weeks will count the same as a normal lab (100 points).
The final presentation will also count as a normal lab grade.
The final project submission will be due during finals week and will give you an opportunity to reclaim points if you've missed some milestones.

# Lab 13 - Presentations

The first 30 minutes of this lab will involve taking the "Super" quiz. Which will count for 2 quiz grades (4% of your overall grade).

The remaining 75 minutes will be spent on group presentations.
Each group will present their project.
I want to see the following information from each group:
* Demo of the game (include multiple levels and power-ups if applicable).
* What challenges did you face during development (from each partner)?
  How did your team solve these?
  > __NOTE:__ These can be both in terms of code and disagreements with the team
* What did you enjoy about the project (from each partner)?
* What did you learn from the project (from each partner)?

You and your partner must present for no fewer than __4 minutes__ and no longer than __6 minutes__.
If your presentation is too long or short I will take off 10 points per minute (__yes, I will be timing__).
> You and your partner should practice presenting before the final lab (At least run through it once)!

If you take longer than 7 minutes, I will likely cut you off (don't make me do this)!

## Submission
In order to receive a grade for this lab, you must be present in lab to present your Breakout game.
I will evaluate your presentation in class.
You are encouraged to submit any supplemental notes or presentations (e.g. A powerpoint), though these are not required.

## Rubric
* 25 - Live demo of your game.
* 40 - Discussion about your project (e.g. Challenges, enjoyment, knowledge gained).
* 35 - Quality of the presentation.
  * Did you keep on topic?
  * Did you speak clearly, concisely, and avoid filler (e.g. "Um", "Like")?
  * Did you have supplemental content (e.g. slides)? (Not necessary, but could help if used correctly).
    * Keep in mind __PowerPoint != Presentation__, don't make slides unless they improve your presentation.

__Presentation Length?__
I will take the final score from above and take off points for going under 4 minutes or over 6 minutes.
For example, a presentation that goes for 6:30 minutes or 3:30 minutes would lose 5 points, while a project that goes for 4:00 minutes exactly or 5:59 minutes would not lose any points.
